# Overview

This is my attempt at AWS (Amazon-Web-Services). I wanted to learn and understand what is was all about and had a challenging but fun time with the service.
I followed a tutorial online and tried to implement a Book Store that the admin could add books or change information, then have a customer who could view as a guest and purchase as a member. I wanted to dip my toe in AWS and found out it is much more in depth that I originally thought it would be. Coding can be difficult as is but Web devolpment is a whole different beast entirly.

# Web Pages

The tutorial gave me most of the template for the books and the code to use for transactions. I tried to implement a movie side in addition to the books portion but ran into issues pushing the project to AWS data base. The first page I had was a simple menu and image for new releases, then a page for what is available then a link to the book side of the project which unfortunatly doesn't work.

# Development Environment

I used VS code the tutorial, [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWDJoK8zw58&t=2086s&ab_channel=EnlearAcademy). I learned about the built in functions of AWS and how to create new backend functions and understand the frame work a little bit more. I will be sure to try a much smaller project next time that will hopfully work better.

I used HTML, CSS. I wanted to write javascript to add to the project but since I couldn't push it I didn't really know where to start and writing code that I couldn't test anyway didn't seam to be a good use of time.
